# extra-history
Conditional history lists for read-from-minibuffer, read-string and read-regexp.
This is useful when you have some commands that use default history lists (`minibuffer-history' & `regexp-history'),
but you would prefer they use specialized history lists (e.g. for `nnmairix-search' search terms).
See the documentation of `extra-history-lists' for more details.
